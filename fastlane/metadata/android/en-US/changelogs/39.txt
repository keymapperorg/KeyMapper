Added
- Remap fingerprint gestures! Android 8.0+ and only on devices which support them. Even devices with the setting to swipe down for notifications might not support this! The dev can't do anything about this.

- Widget/shortcut to launch actions. #459
- Setting to show the first 5 digits of input devices so devices with the same name can be differentiated in Key Mapper lists. #470
- Show a warning at the top of the homescreen if the user hasn't disabled battery optimisation for Key Mapper. #496
- Action option to hold down until the trigger is pressed again. #479
- Action option to change the delay before the next action in the list. #476
- Orientation constraint. #505
- Key Event action option to pretend that the Key Event came from a particular device. #509
- Use duplicates of the same key in a sequence trigger. #513

Changes
- No max limit for sliders (except in settings). #458

Bug Fixes
- Save and restore state for all view models.
- Use View Binding in fragments properly. This should stop random crashes for some users.
- Hold Down action option doesn't work for long press triggers.
- A trigger for a specific device can still be detected if the same buttons on another device are pressed.
- Fix layout of the trigger fragment on some screen sizes so that some things aren't cut off.
