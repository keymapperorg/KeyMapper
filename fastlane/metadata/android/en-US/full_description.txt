What can be remapped?
ONLY HARDWARE buttons can be remapped.

There is NO GUARANTEE any of these buttons will work and this app isn't designed to control games. Your device's OEM/vendor can prevent them from being remapped.

 * Volume buttons.
 * Navigation buttons.
 * Bluetooth/wired keyboards.
 * Buttons on other connected devices should also work.
 * Nintendo Switch JoyCons.
 * Chubby Buttons 2.

You can combine multiple keys from a specific device or any device to form a "trigger". Each trigger can have multiple actions. The keys can be set to be pressed at the same time or one after another in a sequence. Keys can be remapped when they are short pressed, long pressed or double pressed. A keymap can have a set of "constraints" so it only has an effect in certain situations.

What can’t be remapped?
 * Pixel Active Edge
 * OnePlus Alert Slider
 * Power button
 * Bixby button
 * Mouse buttons
 * Dpad, thumb sticks or triggers on game controllers

 Your key maps don't work if the screen is OFF.

What can I remap my keys to do?
 Some actions will only work on rooted devices and specific Android versions.

 * Open an app
 * Open an app shortcut. This feature is very useful since you can tell another app to do something Key Mapper can’t. E.g If your launcher has a shortcut to open the app drawer, you can select that shortcut in this app and make any button open the app drawer.

 * Go home

A Key Mapper keyboard needs to be selected for these to work and you can’t use a soft keyboard at the same time:

** It is recommended to install the Key Mapper GUI Keyboard app because this is a proper keyboard unlike the one built-in to Key Mapper **

 * Input a specific keycode
 * Input a key
 * Insert a block of text

What other things can the app do?
 * Option to show a persistent notification which can pause/resume your keymaps.
 * Automatically change the keyboard to the Key Mapper one and/or show the keyboard picker when a chosen Bluetooth device is connected and switch back to the old one when it is disconnected.
 * Quick settings to pause/resume keymaps and toggle the Key Mapper keyboard.

Permissions
You don't have to grant all the permissions for the app to work. The app will tell you if a permission needs to be granted for a feature to work.

 * Accessibility Service: Basic requirement for remapping to work. It is needed so the app can listen to and block keyevents.
 * Device Admin: To turn the screen off when using the action to turn off the screen.
 * Modify System Settings: To change the brightness and rotation settings.
 * Camera: To control the flashlight.

 On some devices, enabling the accessibility service will disable "enhanced data encryption".
