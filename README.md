## Unleash your keys!

Make custom macros on your keyboard or gamepad, make on-screen buttons in any app, and unlock new functionality from your volume buttons!

Key Mapper supports a huge variety of buttons and keys:

- ALL your phone buttons (volume AND side key)
- Game controllers (D-pad, ABXY, and most others)
- Keyboards
- Mouse buttons
- Headsets and headphones
- Fingerprint sensor

Most devices are already supported, with new devices being added over time. Let us know if it's not working for you and we can prioritize your device.

Not currently supported:
 - Joysticks and triggers (LT,RT) on gamepads

Not enough keys? Design your own on-screen button layouts and remap those just like real keys!

## What shortcuts can I make?

With over 100 individual actions, the sky is the limit.

Build complex macros with screen taps and gestures, keyboard inputs, open apps, control media, and even send intents directly to other apps.


## How much control do I have?

TRIGGERS: You decide how to trigger a key map. Long press, double press, press as many times as you like! Combine keys on different devices, and even include your on-screen buttons.

ACTIONS: Design specific macros for what you want to do. Combine over 100 actions, and choose the delay between each one. Set repeating actions to automate and speed up slow tasks.

CONSTRAINTS: You choose when key maps should run and when they shouldn't. Only need it in one specific app? Or when media is playing? On your lockscreen? Constrain your key maps for maximum control.
